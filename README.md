# ðŸŽ¯ FocusBadge

**FocusBadge** is a minimalist browser extension that helps you stay focused and accountable during work/study hours â€” with integrity.

No distractions. No excuses. Just your word and your badge.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. **Create a Focus Session**  
   - Define which sites to block (e.g., YouTube, Reddit, etc.)
   - Set the days and time ranges for when these sites should be blocked

2. **Lock the Session**  
   - Once a session starts, the configuration is locked
   - You can only add more sites â€” no edits or removals allowed

3. **Automatic Server Pings**  
   - During your active focus hours, the extension pings our server hourly
   - If the session is interrupted (disabled, uninstalled, config tampered, etc.) the session is marked as **stained**

4. **Your Public Badge**  
   - Each device has a public badge page
   - It shows last session check time.
   - Use it to prove your focus streak or keep yourself publicly accountable

## âœ… Integrity Rules

- You cannot pause a session once started
- Disabling or uninstalling the extension stains the session
- Reinstalling or reactivating with the same device and config hash resumes clean session â€” if pings were consistent
- You can only add new websites to the config. Removing a site ends the session.


If you really want to stay focused, wear your badge with pride.
